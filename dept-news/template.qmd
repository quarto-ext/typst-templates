It's our pleasure to announce that our department has recently been awarded the highly-coveted Sixtus Award for Excellence in Chemical Research. This is a massive achievement for our department, and we couldn't be prouder.

The Sixtus Award is a prestigious recognition given to institutions that have demonstrated exceptional performance in chemical research. The award is named after the renowned chemist Sixtus Leung, who made significant contributions to the field of organic chemistry.

This achievement is a testament to the hard work, dedication, and passion of our faculty, students, and staff. Our department has consistently produced groundbreaking research that has contributed to the advancement of the field of chemistry, and we're honored to receive this recognition.
